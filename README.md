# FlashlearnRemade
## Why remake the old one?
The original flashlearn project was made for my A Level project and was the first big project I ever worked on. I was inexperienced and made many mistakes including and not limited to the framework I used.
Throughout University I have developed my coding skills and wanted to demonstrate how much I have improved over the span of 2 years in terms of code quality and learn more about MongoDB and their microservices and cloud storage.

## The purpose of the project
I made this project to create the best flashcard app for my studies. It also proved to be a great exercise in database usage and management.

## Features

* Flashcard database storage using mongoDB
* User profiles stored on the cloud
* The ability to create flashcard sets along with flashcards
* The spaced learning learn mode to help you revise content more efficiently (to be added)
